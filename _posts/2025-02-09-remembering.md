Ani Difranco just popped on the speaker, and I was already feeling whistful. I can hardly hear some of Difranco's songs without thinking back to highschool, a messy, ugly, painful time. I can almost taste the depression at the back of my throat, feel the despair swelling in my eyes.

I don't really know why we thought it was a good idea, being together, dragging each other into that spiral. I don't know if she'd have gone down with me, but I almost definitely would've gone a different way without her. The stories, the lies, they were complicated and painful and somehow we couldn't find anything else once we were surrounded by them.

But we also had this deep, strange love, this passion and gentleness and fierceness. She showed me how to touch, soft and firm and oh, *so delicious*, and she tapped into something I'd buried years ago, almost an addiction in and of itself. That first night, we spent hours together in that half-lit basement - literally the duration of the movie IT - until we fell asleep in each others arms under a tangle of blankets. I could still smell me on her as we drove to church with her family to be lectured about the _sins of the homosexuals_. The irony was thick, and we both felt the weight of the guilt despite neither of us being religious. A sign of an effective sermon, I suppose.

Her sad smile and fiery eyes made me want to dive off a cliff to rescue her. But in the end, I don't think she wanted to be rescued, and I was ready to pull my head up out of the muck when it got bad. I pushed away, and we drifted to different corners of the city, hiding from each other's shadows. Years later, she ran into a family member of mine, told him that she wished me well. I've seen pictures of her since, and she still has that same look, if maybe a little more spent than before. I wish she knew I felt the same, and hope she's ok, and that she's always with me, even decades later.
