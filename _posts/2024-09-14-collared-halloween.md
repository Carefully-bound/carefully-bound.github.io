title:  "A Collared Halloween"
---

It was way too late, especially for a school night, but I needed to see Carry. She always helped me work through these things, and this one, I just couldn't wrap my brain around. As I quietly, slowly pressed the basement door shut, I heard her in the next room over, just starting the credits on her latest anime fixation. I crept in, thinking I'd gone unnoticed - and as long as she couldn't hear me, neither could her family.

She snickered as I got to the door; clearly, I was not as stealthy as I hoped. "Come on, Mel, you aren't _that_ quiet," she crooned, grinning. The second we made eye contact, though, she knew something was off. In the next moment, she was across the room with an arm around my waist, pulling me back towards the couch. We settled into the old, broken down cushions, sinking deep as she twisted sideways and wrapped her legs around me, pulling me into her arms.

"Alright, girlie, what is it? Clearly not a social call." I leaned back, closed my eyes, breathing deep. This was hard. I didn't think it would be this hard. I steeled myself, bracing for her reaction, and started the only place I could think to.

"I... I went to Olivia's thing last night." Carry tensed, holding her breath a little, but waiting for me to talk. "I _know_ you didn't want me to go, but she promised her Jeff wouldn't be there, so I figured it would be fine. And it _was_! He never showed, and she never even mentioned him." Carry let out her breath. There was so much baggage there, but at its core, Olivia's brother Jeff was a class-act jerk who always felt the need to be homophobic anytime the opportunity presented itself. He'd even gotten violent once or twice when drinking, and Halloween seemed like a prime candidate for it.

"OK," she breathed, sounding relieved. "So then, what happened?"

"Olivia's boyfriend Nick _was_ there." None of us had met him, but he was in college while the rest of us were finishing senior year, so there was an air of mystery about him.

"He is, in fact, quite the pretty boy - she wasn't exaggerating one bit. Quiet, too; he just hid on the back couch keeping to himself while everyone else was getting all wound up over Rocky Horror Picture Show." Carry snorted; I could almost _hear_ her rolling her eyes. There'd been a big hype over it as a classic and everyone was talking about their big plans to one-up each other with antics around it, going so far as to even have a showing at the local theater next week.

"Anyway. I wasn't particularly feeling the antics, so we ended up talking about music through most of it. Turns out, he's into a lot of the same stuff I am." I took another deep breath, closing my eyes, exhaling slowly. "I went with him, Liv, and a bunch of others to a diner after, stayed until they closed. By that point he'd come out of his shell and gotten in on the energy of the group. I'd been hanging around him since the music topic - we were having fun. It... " I shivered hard, cut short on my own story.

Carry waited, touching my hair, stroking gently, patiently. "He made some joke about his keys having a built-in leash, and... I don't know how it really happened, it's a bit of a blur, but he looped the key hook extender on my neck and started tugging me to the door on the way out. It was silly at first, we were all laughing. But when we got to the car, he nudged me into the back, kept it there, tugging on it and laughing at my growing discomfort. He let it go after a minute, but I was shook a bit. He swore it was just a joke, apologized when he registered that it'd gone too far."

At this point, it was all just spilling out. The sequence, the details, all fell away; all that mattered was the emotion. I couldn't stop if I wanted to.

"We ended up back on the same couch talking, him and a couple others. Dad was running late picking me up, but most everyone else was leaving. Liv went off to the kitchen to get something, and suddenly, it was just me and Nick." My voice cracked, shaking. "I don't even know what happened, but he had me pinned against the side of the couch, his hand on my throat, keys suddenly back in his hands. I was frozen, and he was pressed against me, grinning, looping that stupid line around my neck with one hand, like he'd practiced it a million times. When he clipped it to itself, making a choke collar, he leaned further forward and... ran his tongue up the side of my my face.

"I could feel him through his pants, Carr - He was hard, getting worked up from choking me. He was clearly getting off on it, and I couldn't move a muscle. I remember hearing myself whimper, but that was all I could manage. And then Liv yelled something from the other room, and Nick just quick-released the keychain, sat back into the seat next to me, and smiled knowingly. Liv came in and was totally oblivious. I didn't know what to say, how to act, so I just... I just sat there. Dad got there a few minutes later, telling some story and totally oblivious to how quiet I was. I was still sort of shell-shocked, I guess. I couldn't even wrap my brain around it."

Carry squeezed me tight, still stroking my hair. She twisted to get in front of me a little more, worry all over her face, mixed with something else I couldn't read. "What can I do, Mel? Want me to call Liv? Your dad? Go kick the guy's ass?" I shook my head at all of it.

"I... I'm not sure. It's so much. I can't understand why I couldn't tell anyone about it. But... I'm not... mad?" She tilted her head at this, waiting. "I don't know Carr. I feel like something sort of... woke up. Sure, it freaked me out. But looking back, now, it wasn't... _completely bad_."

Carry searched my face, her eyes sharp. "Do you think, maybe, you..." She paused, watching me closely. "Liked it a little?" I shivered at that, seeing something more in those shining eyes. Recognizing it. But, maybe that was my imagination?

I looked away, embarrassed, but gave the tiniest nod. "I think it was the intensity. I've never been out of control like that."

Carry reached out with a hooked finger, cupping my chin and turning me back to her. There was definitely something there. An excitement. A hunger. Those powerful eyes bore into me, made me feel somehow weaker, smaller. I couldn't keep eye contact, kept trying to look away, but she locked my face in place with that single finger, an electricity growing between us.

"Would you like to feel that again, Mel?" She was almost purring now, soft but strong. I was suddenly aware of her legs locked around my waist, my perception shifting from comforted to _held_, constrained. My head swam. Was Carry saying what I thought? I must have had it written all over my face, because she shifted her hand to stroke my cheek, a more familiar gesture that softened my anxiety a little.

"I'm not suggesting what he did. That was wrong. He never should have done that without asking, and I _will_ be having a word with him. But my sweet Mel... I think he showed you something about yourself. I want to show you what it _should_ be like, and let you decide." Carry reached up with her other hand, caressing my hair while still stroking my face. It melted me into comfort, and she knew it, just like she knew all my buttons. I closed my eyes and gave a little nod. I trusted her, and whatever this was, I needed to understand it better.

When I finally opened my eyes again, all of her softness had melted away. She was still smiling, but it was sharp, dangerous, a side of Carry I'd never seen before. The hand in my hair slowed it's strokes until it settled at the back of my neck, fingers curling in and grabbing hair, tugging in little bursts, rubbing her fingertips over my scalp.

"It's important you know I will stop the second you ask me to. Just say the word 'red,' we'll stop right there. And if you're feeling uncomfortable, say yellow. Sometimes it can be hard to communicate - it's important you know those words. OK?" I nodded, but she frowned, unconvinced. "Say them for me - yellow, and red."

I opened my mouth and found it heavy, thick, hard to speak suddenly. But I said them for her as she instructed: "Yellow for uncomfortable. Red to stop." She smiled, seeming pleased.

"Good girl." She watched me, waiting, her hand now frozen in my hair, her other hand cupping my face, unmoving. I kept eye contact, as much as I could, but I could see more of that danger in her eyes and broke away again after a moment. She curled the hand in my hair all the way, tugging a little to tip my head back. I shivered, and she chuckled, a throaty sound unlike anything I'd heard from her before.

"This is going to be fun," she purred, as she guided me onto my back on the couch and slid herself on top of me.
