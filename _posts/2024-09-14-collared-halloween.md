title:  A Collaring Halloween
---

It was Halloween night at Tess' place, an upperclassman who I'd always considered too cool to hang out with. Nick was her boyfriend, and he was in fact quite _pretty_. Quiet, too; he just faded into the background on the couch, keeping to himself while everyone else was getting all wound up over Rocky Horror Picture Show. I wasn't particularly feeling the antics, so we ended up talking about music through most of it. Turns out, he was into a lot of the same stuff I am. I was pretty quickly enamoured.

I went with him, his girlfriend Tess, and a bunch of others to a diner after, stayed until they closed. By that point he'd come out of his shell and gotten in on the energy of the group. I'd been hanging around him since the music topic - we were having fun, and Tess didn't seem phased at all.

From here on out, the sequence and the details are all a bit of a blur, but they stitch back together semi-coherently, at least.

Nick made some joke about his keys having a built-in leash, and... I don't know how it really happened, it's a bit of a blur. He looped the key hook extender on my neck and started tugging me to the door on the way out. It was silly at first; we were all laughing. But when we got to the car, he nudged me into the back, kept it there, tugging on it and laughing at my growing discomfort. He let it go after a minute, but I was shook a bit. He swore it was just a joke, apologized when he registered that it'd gone too far.

We ended up back on the same couch talking along with a couple others. My ride was running late, but most everyone else was leaving. Tess went off to the kitchen to get something, and suddenly, it was just me and Nick.

In a flash he had me pinned against the side of the couch, his hand on my throat, keys suddenly back in his hands. I was frozen, and he was pressed against me, grinning, looping that stupid line around my neck with one hand, like he'd practiced it a million times. When he clipped it to itself, making a choke collar, he leaned further forward and ran his tongue up the side of my my face. I could feel him through his pants; he was hard, getting worked up from choking me, clearly getting off on it, and I couldn't move a muscle. I remember hearing myself whimper, but that was all I could manage. It felt like an eternity, a thin cable tensioned on my throat and the heat of his breath against my cheek.

And then, just as suddenly, Tess yelled something from the other room, returning. Nick quick-released the keychain, sat back into the seat next to me, and smiled cooly, knowingly. Tess came in and was totally oblivious. I didn't know what to say, how to act, so I just... sat there. My ride got there a few minutes later, telling some story and totally oblivious to how quiet I was. I was still sort of shell-shocked, I guess. I couldn't even wrap my brain around it.

I wasn't sure what to do with it all; it was just so much. I equally couldn't understand at the time why I couldn't tell anyone about it. Of course, now I understand, further away from the shock of it, with time to process. Sure, I was mad. Furious, frankly, but unsure where to take it. I never told Tess, though we never really spoke again. I think some part of me was afraid that she would call me a liar, defend him.

Regardless, something woke up from that. Unconsentual, realistically - no thanks. But that adrenaline, the loss of control, the absolute intensity of it, is beyond anything else. A primal dynamic, predator and prey, filled with animal instinct and everything else just falls away.
