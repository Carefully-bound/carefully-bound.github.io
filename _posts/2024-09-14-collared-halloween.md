It was Halloween, 2001; I was 15, and invited to a party with some upper-classmen and their friends. Ness invited me to come out with her friends, and as someone who looked up to Ness in a "no one cound possibly be cooler" sort of light, I was more than excited to join in, though maybe a little nervous. I was an absolute social warrior though - long ago, I was taught to never shy away from a crowd or strangers. So I went, excited but trepidatious.

To be honest, much of the night was a blur.
