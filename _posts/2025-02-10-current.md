It's been a _very_ long time since I've sat down and really written, but someone got under my skin, and this time getting over covid has left me with more space to think and chew. So, without further adieu...

Thrums of heartbeats
in synchrony
create a current
impossible to fight.
The waves toss me
through the throng of bodies,
all but losing myself in them.

But I can feel you,
seeking, closing in,
tracking, humming
a different chord,
sharper than the rest.

A sudden heavy quieting
as the confluence of paths
breaks loose the current,
spilling us apart
in separate directions.

Sweat and exhaustion 
coat my skin, 
aimless, spent, jetsam
clinging to the edges.
A sweet breath as time pauses,
just for a beat,
just long enough to 
regain my footing.

You approach, stealth
in the relative quiet,
but I can still hear you,
dark and warm and rhythmic
and dangerous.

And as you close in,
our eyes connect, and
electricity swells between us -
across the room,
miles away,
inches apart.

The only thrum of a heartbeat
remaining is mine,
filling my ears,
filling my throat,
watching you approach
as you match pace.

Locked frozen,
I ache, I dread, I wait,
Desperately wanting
to find your rhythm
as you have already
found mine.

The final beat is
not mine, though,
never mine,
and I ache the more for it,
always.
